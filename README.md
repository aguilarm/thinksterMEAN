Learning the MEAN Stack
=========

I'm just using this project to learn the MEAN stack

Following <a href="https://thinkster.io/angulartutorial/mean-stack-tutorial/">thinkster.io's mean stack tutorial</a>, and adding tons of comments everywhere so I can use this as a refrence if I need to.

Potato News is a horrible placeholder name I'm using.
