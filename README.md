Learning the MEAN Stack
=========

I'm just using this project to learn the MEAN stack.

The thinkster article shows you how to use the whole stack to make a simple article app kind of like reddit.  It has comments tied to each article, and an upvote system for individual posts and comments.

I've found it is kind of sloppy syntax and could probably be organized a lot better, but it's still a great starting point from which to improve.

Following <a href="https://thinkster.io/angulartutorial/mean-stack-tutorial/">thinkster.io's mean stack tutorial</a>, and adding tons of comments everywhere so I can use this as a refrence if I need to.

Potato News is a horrible placeholder name I'm using.
