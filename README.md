Learning the MEAN Stack
=========

Following <a href="https://thinkster.io/angulartutorial/mean-stack-tutorial/">thinkster.io's mean stack tutorial</a>, and adding tons of comments everywhere so I can use this as a refrence if I need to.

Potato News is a horrible placeholder name I'm using, I'm just using this project to learn the MEAN stack better.

The thinkster article shows you how to use the whole stack to make a simple article app kind of like reddit.  It has comments tied to each article, and an upvote system for individual posts and comments.

I've found it is kind of sloppy syntax and could probably be organized a lot better, but it's still a great starting point from which to improve.

As of 10/9/2014 the entire tutorial is complete, with a few expanded features.
I've learned a lot, and it's mostly about how this is good for understanding basics, but I've found a lot of things that could be done better.  I'm going to put this to rest and whip up a new blank project using some of these points:

The '#' is shown in the HTML, and to remove it I'd have to switch all of the express routes to an /api/ rather than the links used here
Organization.  Inline views?  Controllers/Services all in same file.  Not a huge deal but eh.
Mostly fixed as I went, but the JS syntax was inconsistent.
